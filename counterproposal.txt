Chiptune generator

Phase 1: Create a domain-specific language that lets you write expressions
  expressing the frequency of the tune over time, as a function of time and
  as a function of a limited previous number of samples.

Requires: being able to play software-defined sound samples

Also: Add export to .mp3 using LAME or something

I like the idea of making a tracker. Maybe we could make a library function for
the DSL which reads sound data from a table in a file?
