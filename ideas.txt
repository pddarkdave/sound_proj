Chiptune generator

Phase 1: Make a simple GUI that shows you the option for which note to play.
   OR, maybe, which frequency within some range.
   Possibility:
   Note dropdown menu, immutable text field showing frequency.
It will only make a sine wave initially, given the parameter of frequency.

Use pulse code modulation for now.

LATER ON: Add the possibility of a square wave, triangle wave, sawtooth wave.

Consider it 16-bit audio, mono initially.

Even later: add possibility for effects.

Eventually:
    make an audio format representing a song!
    higher bitrate possible

Longer-term ambitions:
    taking sound samples, making something tracker-like
